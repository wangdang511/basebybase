            <P><B>Description:</B> Base-By-Base is a whole genome pairwise and multiple alignment editor. Base-By-Base
                hilights differences between pairs of alignments and allows the user to easily navigate large alignemts
                of similar sequences. Although Base-By-Base was intended as an editor and viewer for alignmets of highly
                similar sequences, it is also provides many of the functions of other generic alignment editors.</P>
