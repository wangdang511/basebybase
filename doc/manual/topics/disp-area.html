<H4>General</H4>
<P>Base-By-Base provides the ability to narrow down the field of view within an alignment. If an alignment is too large,
    or the region of interest for a particular alignment is much smaller than the entire file, users can limit the
    amount of data displayed and processed in reports.</P>
<P>To set the display area for the current view, click the 'Set Display Area' button on the <A
        HREF="../toolbar/index.html">Base-By-Base Toolbar</A>. This will bring up the following window:</P>
<IMG SRC="../images/disp-area-window.png"><BR>
<P>Enabling the 'Endpoint' checkbox means that the view will extend to or from the end of the alignment in that
    direction. To set the display area to encompass a limited region within the view, not including either end, uncheck
    the 'Endpoint' box for both the left and right side and enter values in for each boundary.</P>

<H4>Side Effects</H4>
<P>The main side effect of setting the display area is that the scroll bar will now only scroll around within the
    display area. Below is a list of other side effects of changing the display area:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>CDS Statistics report and Event Breakdown now only take into account events/features which fall between the
        bounds of the display area.
    </LI>
    <LI>Searching for the next and last difference or the next and last comment will now only search for those which
        exist within the bounds of the display area.
    </LI>
    <LI>The gene pulldown list will only make available genes within the bounds of the display area.</LI>
