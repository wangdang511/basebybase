<P>With Base-By-Base, it is possible to search within each sequence for a given motif accounting for ambiguities and
    missmatches. The Fuzzy Motif Search allows users to enter in an expression pattern (see below for an explanation of
    the pattern grammar used) as well as a maximum number of mismatches tolerated in a search hit. BBB then searches
    marked sequences for this motif and displays a list of hits sortable by confidence or by location along the
    sequence. In addition to the ambiguities created by mismatches, users may enter in IUB ambiguity codes, which are
    also indicated below.</P>

<P>Pattern Grammar: This grammar is similar to that of the program fuzznuc which is included in the EMBOSS suite of
    bioinformatics software.<BR><BR>
<UL>
    <LI>ACT - indicates an A, C, T pattern</LI>
    <LI>[AC]T - indicates an A or a C followed by a T</LI>
    <LI>{AC}T - indicates anything BUT an A or a C followed by a T</LI>
    <LI>ACT(1,3) - indicates an A then C followed by 1, 2 or 3 T's</LI>
</UL>
<BR><BR>
When counting missmatches, [] and {} count as a single match or mismatch. As well, if matching T(2,4) and only 1 T is
found, this counts as a single mismatch.
